NLP is the subset of Machine Learning in which we work on text and documents.It consists of different models like bigram,trigram or n-gram models.
In this project we have used the concept of NLP and some preprocessing steps like stopwords removal or stemming.
In this project the tweets are labelled as "collusive" or "genuine".To work on this further we need to some conversion:

label : collusive -> convert this to label '0'
label : genuine -> convert this to label '1'

We have used LabelEncoder technique for this conversion.
